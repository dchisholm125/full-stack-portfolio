<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. </p>
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>Reality is more than what it seems, and time may be circular.</p>
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>A beautiful love story about forgetting the pain of an ex-lover, or embracing something new.</p>
