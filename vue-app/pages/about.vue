    <h1>About Derek</h1>
    <p>Somewhere between a nerd and a jock, I've always been competitive, fun-loving, and curious. I love intellectual thought and humor. Spreading laughter and philosophy
      is a rewarding thing, and I enjoy giving people a different perspective on the things we consider "normal" in our society. My reach can sometimes exceed my grasp, and I know it.
      I am an expert classical pianist, and attempted to start my own video game composing business in 2015. In 2017, I founded a real estate CRM start-up which fizzled after the founders
      realized the space was over-saturated with similar products. This sparked my interest in software engineering and opened my mind up to the amazing world of coding/programming.
      Since then, I have discovered my ultimate skillset: problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>I am a problem solver. I enjoy helping others when I hear a complicated, unresolved issue that is in my wheelhouse of knowledge and wisdom.
      It's gratifying to just make someone's life better by giving them my time!
    </p>
    <p>In terms of my traditional professional, I have worn many hats: 
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Software Implementation Consultant</li>
        <li>Mutual Fund Accountant</li>
        <li>Escrow Operations Analyst</li>
        <li>Real Estate Broker</li>
        <li>Full Stack Software Engineer</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      I am great at uniting those around me towards a common goal, getting technical and non-technical team members aligned on deliverables, staying well ahead of deadlines,
      and managing cross-functional communication with key team members. I am a Technical Project Manager at heart, have full stack developer skills, and belong working within
      the software development cycle where my skills are most valuable. 
    </p>
    <p>While my coding skills are above-average, I have experience in client-facing roles with high-level executives and know how to manage expectations in stressful situations.
      I have a seat on the Advisory Board of a Venture Aerospace, and am excited to contribute to the strategic plan for the company. I know how to turn high-level goals into 
      action, and keep teams on-task to achieve our ultimate goal.
